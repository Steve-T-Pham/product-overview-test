                    Inkjet printing technology uses miniscule, 
                    liquid ink droplets that are propelled onto paper or other substances during the printing process, 
                    where they rapidly dry to produce high-quality, high-resolution colorful texts and images.

                    Dye-based inks are less expensive. They are able to produce more vibrant colors when printing as the ink is absorbed
                    into the fiber of the material. Dye-based ink is ideal for printing customer facing product labels that require
                    colorful texts or images. Pigment-based inks are more resilient when printing. The ink sits on the surface
                    of the material it is printed on and fuses with the fibers. Pigment-based ink is ideal for printing durable labels,
                    such as GHS and BS 5609 compliant labels.

                    Inkjet printing supports roll and fanfold labels, as well as tags. Roll labels must have 3" core inner diameter. Perforated
                    or non perforated labels can be used as well as continuous labels. Many inkjet printers support labels with glossy or 
                    matte finishes for applications that require different vibrancy or reflectivity levels. We carry various label sizes 
                    in different materials and colors to ensure you are choosing the best label for your application.
